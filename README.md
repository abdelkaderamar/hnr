# HNR (Hackernews Reader)

 HNR is my personnal app to read [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website.

## Why this web app ?

I used Hackernews through it website and also with the mobile app [materialistic](https://github.com/hidroh/materialistic). The mobile app has a lot features I needed and that are useful to me (saving and exporting stories, a clean interface), but I needed additional features to fit all my needs. These feature are:
* Hide already visited or non intersting stories
* Export saved stories in a textual format, markdown or yaml so I can process them
* Create lists by keywords
* Feed my link aggregator [Kopikol](https://github.com/abdelkaderamar/kopikol)
